# Data Sources

>PubMed CentralÂ® (PMC) is a free full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM). 
>
>The Open Access Subset (OA Subset) is the largest collection of articles available for text mining via PMC. Articles in the OA Subset are still protected by copyright in most cases, but are made available for download under a Creative Commons or similar license that generally allows more liberal redistribution and reuse than a traditional copyrighted work. 
>
>To download a collection in PMC for text mining, you must use the designated services (usually the PMC FTP service).
